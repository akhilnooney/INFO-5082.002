There are Multiple Drugs in the Market for every health issue sometimes it is very difficult for the patients to sit for long time in waiting room until they get there turn for doctor’s appointment and getting some medicines suggested by doctors. Now we can get rid from all these processes and make easy for both doctors and patients by developing a Medicine Recommendation System using Machine Learning. 
My Primary goal of this project is to build a no-frills recommendation system where that can be trusted by both doctors and patients. One more important use is, patients can check their own medications suggested by software for any kind of health issues and doctors can check their assumptions while writing patients prescription. 
This Medication Recommendation System has capable of predicting accurate medicines based on users input of diseases or symptoms which they had. Some other uses can be patients can have Second opinion about the medicines which are recommended by their doctor. could help in expanding the productivity of clinical treatment. Recommending Standard medicines. Reducing Personal cost.
Analysis:
•	By collecting Medicine data, I am going to analyze which medicine is suitable for each medical issue.
•	What are the different types of medicines that can be suggested to patients for a disease.
Flow of my Project:
1.	Cleaning and Preparing data.
2.	Analyzing data.
3.	Build Machine Learning Model on the data
4.	Validate my Model by analyzing & Tuning.
5.	Integrate UI and ML Model
